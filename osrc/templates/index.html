<h1 id="how-it-works">
    How it works
</h1>

<p>
Every day, many thousands of open source contributions are made on
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> by developers around the world.
This data is publicly available through
<a href="http://developer.github.com">the API</a> and&mdash;even more
conveniently&mdash;on the <a href="http://githubarchive.org/">GitHub
Archive</a>. This is generally a pretty fun dataset to play with but it
is particularly exciting for hackers because we get to play with data that
describes <i>our own behavior</i>! Last year, shortly after the full event
stream was publicly released,
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1118-the-github-data-challenge">the first
annual GitHub data challenge</a> produced
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1162-github-data-challenge-winners">some
sick data visualizations</a> and it's clear that people at GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions">have</a>
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1476-get-up-to-speed-with-pulse">been</a>
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1359-the-octoverse-in-2012">thinking</a>
about how to Use The Data For Goodâ„¢.
</p>

<p>
The one graph that is especially awesome
in all sorts of surprising ways is the
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions">contributions
heat map</a> on every user's profile page. What sets this apart from the
other visualizations that already exist on the site? It makes a <i>general
statement</i> about <i>one specific user</i>. It lets a developer have a
global view of their contributions, skills and habits. This ends up being
extremely motivating because it lets the developer see their progress in
real time. With this in mind, it seemed like a good idea to provide a more
complete set of global statistics summarizing the hacker personality of
any GitHub user.

<p>
So that's what I did.
