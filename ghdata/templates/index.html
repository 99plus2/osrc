<h1>
    How it works
</h1>

<p>
Every day, many thousands of open source contributions are made on
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> by developers around the world.
This data is publicly available through
<a href="http://developer.github.com">the API</a> and&mdash;even more
conveniently&mdash;on the <a href="http://githubarchive.org/">GitHub
Archive</a>. This is generally a pretty fun dataset to play with but it
is particularly exciting for hackers because we get to play with data that
describes <i>our own behavior</i>! Last year, shortly after the full event
stream was publicly released,
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1118-the-github-data-challenge">the first
annual GitHub data challenge</a> produced
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1162-github-data-challenge-winners">some
sick data visualizations</a> and it's clear that people at GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions">have</a>
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1476-get-up-to-speed-with-pulse">been</a>
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1359-the-octoverse-in-2012">thinking</a>
about how to Use The Data For Good™.
</p>

<p>
The one graph that is especially awesome
in all sorts of surprising ways is the
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions">contributions
heat map</a> on every user's profile page. What sets this apart from the
other visualizations that already exist on the site? It makes a <i>general
statement</i> about <i>one specific user</i>. It lets a developer have a
global view of their contributions, skills and habits. This ends up being
extremely motivating because it lets the developer see their progress in
real time. With this in mind, it seemed like a good idea to provide a more
complete set of global statistics summarizing the hacker personality of
any GitHub user.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I did.
</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>

<p>
The most convenient place to download historical event data for GitHub is
probably <a href="http://www.igvita.com/">Ilya Grigorik</a>'s
<a href="http://www.githubarchive.org/">GitHub Archive</a> where you
can download the contents of
<a href="https://github.com/timeline.json">timeline.json</a>&mdash;dumped in
hour long chunks&mdash;as gzipped JSON<small>(ish)</small> files. For this
project, I decided to freeze the scope and only download the event stream for
January, February and March 2013. As you'll see in a moment, however,
the final analysis is only based on accumulated statistics so it wouldn't be
much harder to make these reports real time. I used
<a href="https://github.com/dfm/osrc/blob/master/fetch.py">a Python script</a>
to download the dataset but something like
</p>

<pre>
wget http://data.githubarchive.org/2012-{01..03}-{01..31}-{0..23}.json.gz
</pre>

<p>
should work just as well.
</p>

<p>
After downloading all of the data, I looped through all the activity and
accumulated statistics about each user (and various global statistics) in
a <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> database. Redis is ideal for this
project because the <a href="http://redis.io/commands#sorted_set">sorted
set</a> and <a href="http://redis.io/commands#hash">hash table</a> data
structures are perfect for answering questions like <i>what is a user's most
common type of activity?</i> or <i>what is the distribution of push events
in a particular user's average week?</i> Also, the memory requirements for
this database should scale roughly linearly with the number of active users
(not the number of events) so running on a larger dataset (or in real time)
wouldn't require a significantly more expensive infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
Again, I used <a href="https://github.com/dfm/osrc/blob/master/process.py">a
Python script</a> to perform this analysis. I saved a whole lot of summary
statistics but I'll only describe a few here so that you don't get too bored.
First, I accumulated some global statistics like
</p>

<ul>
    <li>the number of events on a Monday,</li>
    <li>the number of push events,</li>
    <li>the total number of contributions to JavaScript projects, and</li>
    <li>the number of times the word "damn"&mdash;and other more offensive
        words&mdash;was used in the commit message of a Python code base.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then, for each user, I aggregated a summary of their behavior, including
</p>

<ul>
    <li>their average weekly and daily schedules,</li>
    <li>the number of events of different types,</li>
    <li>their total number of contributions to repositories in different
        languages,</li>
    <li>their favorite <a href="https://github.com/dfm/osrc/blob/master/ghdata/static/swears.txt">swear words</a>,</li>
    <li>their number of contributions to repositories owned by others&mdash;and
        hence, their "connection" to that user.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this database in place, it was then time to start having fun!
</p>

<h2>Summary Statistics</h2>

<p>
Given this large set of activity statistics, I needed to come up with some
set of measurements that robustly describe a user's behavior. I came up with
a few that I then integrated into this project but there's no doubt that
there are many other relevant and illuminating features.
</p>

<p>
One feature that I expected to be interesting (<i>spoiler alert</i>: it was)
is the <strong>average weekly schedule</strong>. The average weekly schedule
is the normalized histogram of a user's activity on each day of the week. It
seemed likely that some users would work mostly on the weekends while others
would work exclusively during the week, for example. To study this, I
extracted the set of weekly schedule vectors for 10000 "moderately active"
GitHub users and ran
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-means</a> (with
<code>K=12</code>) on this sample set. K-means is an algorithm for the
unsupervised clustering of samples in a vector space. In particular, it
assumes that your samples come from <code>K</code> distinct "classes" and
it finds a representative vector for each cluster. After removing three
redundant means (come on, we're just having fun here :-) and labelling each
cluster with a human readable name, the results were very exciting! The
chart below shows the resulting means for each class of user. Click on the
names on the right to see the other classes.
</p>

<div class="hist-block">
    <div id="week" class="hist"></div>
    <div id="week-legend" class="hist"></div>
    <div id="week-rep"></div>
</div>

<p>
Isn't it exciting when the results of an experiment match your expectations?
</p>

<p>
Another related statistic is the <strong>average daily schedule</strong> but
looking at this one is a little bit more complicated. All of the timestamps
in the dataset are given in UTC (and sometimes PST, it seems) but most of the
developers that use GitHub don't live in that time zone. It doesn't make a
lot of sense to compare an American developer's daily schedule with that of
an Australian unless you can correct for the time offset. The best way that I
could think of for doing this was to fake it using the location field on the
user's GitHub profile if they filled it out. Even if this field was filled
out, there's no guarantee that it actually corresponds to a real place.
There's also the problem that a lot of people travel! With this in mind,
you should probably take the daily schedule with a grain of salt but it
can still be fun to look at. I, for example, seem to work best
<a href="/dfm#day">right before lunch and right before dinner</a>… I guess
I should just stay hungry more often!
</p>

<p>
The final statistic that I would like to mention is <strong>behavior
space</strong>. The idea is that you can describe a user's behavior as a
single vector in a high-dimensional vector space. Then, other users that
are nearby in this space are similar. The validity of these assumptions
is definitely suspect but it's always fun to compare yourself to other
people so let's do it anyways. For this project, I chose the following
features to describe a user:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>the total number of contributions,</li>
    <li>the average weekly schedule,</li>
    <li>the fraction of events of different types,</li>
    <li>the fraction of contributions to repositories of the
        <a href="https://github.com/dfm/osrc/blob/master/ghdata/static/languages.txt">top
        30 most popular languages</a>, and</li>
    <li>the number of contributions, connections, active repositories and
        languages used.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This leads to a 61-dimensional representation of each user's behavior.
In order to find nearby users in this space, I used the Python bindings
in <a href="http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php">Marius Muja</a>'s
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/FLANN">Fast Library
for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN)</a> to build an index over 50000
"moderately active" users in behavior space. The lookup on this index is
extremely efficient so it's easy to look up a list some number of users that
exhibit similar behavior to a particular user. For example,
<a href="/mariusmuja">Marius Muja</a>'s own profile shows that his hacker
personality is similar to <a href="/bdpayne">Bryan Payne</a>'s.
</p>

<h2>The Report</h2>

<p>
For some reason, I really wanted to have the end product of this analysis be
an <i>automatically-generated prose description</i> of a user's activity
based on the gathered statistics. I decided that it was alright if the text
was backed up with figures but the focus should really be on the text. To do
this, I resorted to building something like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system">an old-school expert
system</a>. In other words, I made up a bunch of rules
(implemented as a spaghetti of nested if statements) that concatenate strings
until something like English prose falls out the other end. It would be fun
to try to do something more sophisticated or intelligent than this but we'll
have to live with this for now and I think that you'll be surprised by
how well this actually works. The <small>(horrifying)</small> code that
generates the summaries is
<a href="https://github.com/dfm/osrc/blob/master/ghdata/__init__.py#L195">available
on GitHub</a> <small>(obviously)</small> so I won't get too deep into the
details here but I wanted to comment on one little hidden gem.
</p>

<p>
As part of generating the report, it was necessary to produce a prose
comparison of two users. I decided to break this out to it's own endpoint
at the URL:
</p>

<pre>
http://osrc.dfm.io/{username}/compare/{other_username}
</pre>

<p>
This means that if we want to compare the behavior of two of GitHub's
founders (<a href="/mojombo">mojombo</a> and <a href="/defunkt">defunkt</a>),
we can just hit up the URL
<a href="/mojombo/compare/defunkt">osrc.dfm.io/mojombo/compare/defunkt</a>
and see something like "<span id="comp-demo"></span>".
</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
At this point, this demo should really only be thought of as a
proof-of-concept because there are many other interesting statistics and
descriptions that could be determined from this dataset. That being said,
I think that it does represent a big step in an interesting direction.
